# What we need to do here

- Consider one of the following options
  - Get a copy running in genesis preprod server
  - Just log in into cloud and fuck the service with queries
  - Get an approximation instead of the exact thing by checking f' metrics from datadog


- Get the data from whatever option you chose

- Get at the very least this information
  - Clusterization of orgs by org type, I expect something like big-ass orgs, intermediate orgs etc, but this clustering can even be more specific (e.g. by activity, how forgetful org guys are of leftovers etc)
  - Distribution of such orgs in our cloud environment
  - Basic, "average" information of each cluster representative (num users, num jobs, num pipelines, num engines, active jobs, scheduled tasks, subscriptions etc)
